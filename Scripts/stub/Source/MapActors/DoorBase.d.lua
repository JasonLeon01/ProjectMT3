--- Base door actor that plays sprite-sheet open and close animations.
---
--- The texture should contain frames arranged horizontally (left to right).
--- When `openDoor()` is called, the door advances through each frame at
--- `openInterval` seconds, then self-destructs. When `closeDoor()` is called,
--- the door animates from the current frame back to the first frame. The frame
--- count is derived from the texture width, the initial rect origin, and the
--- frame width. The door is NOT `animatable` — animations are driven manually
--- in `onTick()`.
---
--- `tickable` keeps the Actor default `False`; valid open/close playback
--- enables it only until the animation completes or the Actor is destroyed.
--- Calling `openDoor()` or `closeDoor()` while the same animation is already
--- running is a safe no-op.
