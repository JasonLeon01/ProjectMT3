# LudorkSample 1.0.0 Licences and Third-Party Notices

Ludork itself is licensed under the Zlib License in [`LICENSE.md`](LICENSE.md). That licence applies to Ludork software; it does not replace the licences of the components and assets listed below.

This notice covers the Game project and the unchanged runtime/assets in Ludork 1.0.0 templates; projects must notice their own additions. Canonical runtime texts live in the repository's top-level `Licenses` and are copied to the same distribution paths; asset texts stay beside assets, and C++ templates retain source-tree notices. Editor, managed-runtime, preview-host and build-tool dependencies remain covered by the editor distribution.
